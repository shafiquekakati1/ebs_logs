                <description>This EMM cause code is sent to the network when the USIM detects that the Sequence Number (SQN) in the Authentication Request message is out of range (see 3GPP TS 33.401).
This can happen if the network has used up several authentication vectors without successfully establishing a security context with the UE.
This can happen if the HSS and the HLR generate authentication vectors independently for a UE performing IRAT between LTE and GSM/WCDMA.</description>

SEVERE_NETWORK_FAILURE is sent to the UE when the network has determined that the requested procedure cannot be completed successfully due to network failure. The failure is not expected to be temporary and repeated request is not likely to succeed in near future.
SYNTACTICAL_ERROR_IN_THE_TFT_OPERATION indicates a syntactic error in the TFT operation.
For example:
- When the TFT operation = "Create a new TFT" and the packet filter list in the TFT IE is empty.
- When the TFT operation = "No TFT operation" with a non-empty packet filter list in the TFT IE.
- When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the TFT IE, such as a mismatch between the number of packet filters subfield, and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list.</description>

            <description>The Authentication procedure toward the UE or the Send Authentication Info procedure toward the HLR failed.
In combination with RIL3 CC#20, this means that an Authentication and Ciphering Failure was received from the UE with the "MAC failure" cause code (#20). This GMM cause code is sent to the network if the USIM detects that the MAC in the Authentication Request or Authentication and Ciphering Request message is not fresh (see 3GPP TS 33.102). This can happen when the authentication parameters K, OP/OPc or authentication algorithm in the HLR/AUC and the USIM don't match.
In combination with RIL3 CC#23, this means that an Authentication and Ciphering Failure was received from the UE with the "GSM Authentication Unacceptable" cause code (#23). This GMM cause code is sent to the network in Iu mode if a USIM is inserted in the MS and there is no Authentication Parameter AUTN IE present in the Authentication Request or Authentication and Ciphering Request message.</description>

            <description>The GGSN/PGW responded with the "New PDP type due to single address bearer only" GTPv1 cause code (#130).
This cause code indicates that the MS has requested the IPv4v6 PDP type and both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing is possible in the PDN but the Dual Address Bearer Flag of the Common Flags IE is set to 0 or the Common Flags IE is absent, or only single IP version addressing is possible in the PDN.</description>

If the MME is the source node of inter-MME S1-Based Handover, troubleshoot the source MME and the source eNodeB. Check that the target TAI is not defined in more than one MME pool using the show_mme_tracking_area and show_tracking_area_supporting_global_enodeb CLI commands. In the DNS, check that the target TAI points to an MME which serves the target eNodeB. Make sure that each TAI is only registered to one MME pool.

If an incorrectly configured eNodeB is removed from the MME pool when troubleshooting the MME, delete it using the action_mme_delete_global_enodeb CLI command.

Then, troubleshoot the eNodeB.</action>
